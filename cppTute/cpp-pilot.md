# Differene between C and C++

## C
Procedural programming langauge ,                                                                                                  
Emphasis on PROCEDURE or STEPS and SEQUENCE to solve large problem.                                                           
Functions and Sequence of calls are  building block of C

```
task A
   do subTaskA1()
   do subTaskA2()
   do subTaskA3()
task B
  do subTaskB1()
  do subTaskB2()
  do subTaskB3()
```

## C++ is a Hybrid programming language 
PROCEDURE + OOP (Object Oriented Programming ) language                                                         
Emphasis on OBJECT model rather than Procedure/STEPS                                                                  
CLASSES (BluePrint) and OBJECTS (Instances) are fundamental building blocks in C++                                            
                                                                                                                              
With the help of the Classes and Objects , It is very easy to relate external world and solving the problem                                          
Eg- Game: Player Batsman Boller score Enemy etc

Easily Define Game rule

Create funcationalites of Player 

Specialization like  Batsman , hit() run() 


# C++ is more secure than C 
  In C , data is by default: public ==> Not secured ==> Any external Function can excess/modify/destroy data                           
  
  While  C++ has Data hiding capabilites through access specifier ,                                       
  We can provide controlled access to data by using access specifier 
  (private , protected , public section)
